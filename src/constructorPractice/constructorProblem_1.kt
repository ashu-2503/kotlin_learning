/*
Challenge: Enhanced Student Class

ğŸ§¾ Requirements:
You need to create a class Student that supports:

Primary constructor for:
name: String
rollNumber: Int

Secondary constructor that also accepts:
email: String
age: Int

In the secondary constructor, perform the following validations:
Email must contain @
Age must be >= 5 and <= 100

If either email or age is invalid:
Skip assigning them
Print a message like Invalid email or Invalid age
Use null as the default for unassigned fields like email and age.
